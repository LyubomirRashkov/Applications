## Mathematical Expressions Solver

This is a solver for mathematical expressions. 

The built-in functions are addition ('+'), subtraction ('-'), multiplication ('\*'), division ('/') and raising to power ('^').

It is smart - it works with brackets. So, you just type the expression and the application will take care of the order of operations.

It can work with fractional numbers but only with positive ones. Although, if you want to evaluate some expressions that has negative numbers you can take a look below. There are some examples how to make your expression to be valid for this solver. The result of the expression can be a real number (negative, zero or positive).

Examples:
  + \- operand1 * operand2 => (0 - operand1) * operand2;
  + operand1 + - operand2 => operand1 + (0 - operand2);
  + operand1 - - operand2 => operand1 + operand2;
  + operand1 * - operand2 => operand1 * (0 - operand2);
  + operand1 / - operand2 => operand1 / (0 - operand2);
  + operand1 ^ - operand2 => (0 - operand1) ^ operand2.

In further versions this inconvenience will be removed...
